Final Project Experiences
=========================================

### Environment

It took a lot of help in order to get my environment in a position where I felt like I could actually start coding.
Thank you for taking the time to help me get that set up.

### Bumps

I could never figure out exactly what I needed to get this project in a place where I could attempt to do integration 
testing with postman. I think that I needed to add adapters to work with SQL and some more dependency things. I ran 
out of time to try to finish those. I watch some plural sight videos to try to help me figure out how to do it, and 
they were helpful but just I just didn't wrap my head completely around how to do it. 

Codeception took a while for me to get working. I tried to make a class with out having codeception make the class
from the command prompt. It wasn't reading it and so I ran the command in the terminal and it could run that test. 
Later I realized that the way I named the test class was wrong, and that is why it wasn't running it. 

One big mistake is pushing files up on GITHUB that maybe I shouldn't have and I am not sure how to remove them...

### TIME

I ran out of time to attempt to put the username and email into the redis database. I ran out of time to make the 
adapters, to finish the plugins, and all of the things that would actually tie my database to the code, and just 
attempt to finish this project. I even participated in a study group outside of class with Blaine, Blake, and Lisa to 
get help and finish this project. 

### Learning

This class has really helped me understand how code should be used. I liked the fun inserts of internet security
(or lack there of). I have never had a teacher explain how all of the elements that I am coding fit together. I
still don't fully understand it, but I know more now than I did before. Thank you.

### THANK YOU

Thank you for understanding about my vacation and allowing me to turn this assignment in early. I am glad that I at least got this far. I was worried that I wasn't even
going to get this far in the assignment. I am excited to take the next class with you Fall semester. You are a 
great teacher thank you :)
